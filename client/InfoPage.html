        <p>Mechanical keyboards are more than just a fancy tech accessory or noisy-disco-show to display
          on your desk. Mechanical keyboards are a full blown hobby with a huge cult following, years of history
          containing community DIY projects and group buys, dedicated forums (and silly forum drama), niche’s within the
          niche (like artisan keycaps), and more recently big brand names investing, collaborating, and directly
          interacting with the enthusiast community.
          <br>
          Everyone has their own opinion about why mechanical keyboards are better than common membrane keyboards. To me
          there is only one definitive answer. On a mechanical keyboard the key registers (actuates) midway into the
          keypress, not at the very bottom like on a membrane keyboard. This small detail makes typing on a mechanical
          keyboard far more accurate and comfortable, especially when typing for long durations. People can argue over
          what feels better all day long, but I've never heard a good argument for membrane keyboards being better in
          terms of how they actuate.
          <br>
          At first, this may seem like a small difference, but in reality it makes all the difference in the world. With
          a rubber dome you naturally type harder to ensure the keystroke registers, often hitting a key much harder
          than is required when typing at speed. On a mechanical keyboard it is possible to type lighter and faster due
          to the higher actuation point. The way mechanical keyboards feel compared to membrane keyboards is still the
          obvious and glaring difference between membrane and mechanical keyboards. <span id="partRef"></span>You can
          get tactile switches, clicky
          tactile switches, linear switches, and even clicky linear switches now! The springs used in most mechanical
          switches make them feel very crisp compared to the cheap, mushy rubber used in many membrane keyboards.
          Modifications can provide near limitless options in regards to how a mechanical keyboard feels.

      <h3 id="partSec">The Different Parts</h3>
      <div>
        <h5>Layout and Sizes</h5>
        <p>
          With mechanical keyboards you have a huge variety of keyboard sizes, and are able to really find a size that
          suits you best. Common sizes include fullsize (TK, tenkeyless (TKL), and in the last five years 60% keyboards.
          Variants of all of these sizes exist, along with everything in between. There are even some boards as small as
          30% (Gherkin) and as large as 150ish% (Hyper7)! <a
            href="https://www.massdrop.com/talk/947/keyboard-layouts-explained-in-detail-many-pics">This article</a>
          shows many of the more common layouts available
          today.
        </p>
        <h5>Switches</h5>
        <p>
          Switches are the heart and soul of a mechanical keyboard. Switches are the individual mechanisms beneath the
          keycaps that determine what kind of feel (and sound) a keyboard will have. For many people, the real draw of
          mechanical keyboards is the feeling provided by these mechanical switches.
          <br>
          Switches are commonly referred to by color. You'll see people saying things like "I have a Poker with Reds,"
          or "I put Ergo-Clears in my OTD." With switches, color is much more than just an aesthetic choice, it’s a
          quick way to know exactly how a switch will sound and feel once you become familiar with all of the brands and
          variants available.
          <br>
          Cherry MX switches and clones are by far the most popular mechanical switch on the market. MX mounts are also
          compatible with nearly all custom keycap sets, so if swapping out keycaps
          is something you're interested in, go for MX varieties.
          <br>
          Alps are the second most popular switch on the market, followed by Topre, though neither are utilized in any
          common mass produced keyboard you are likely to find in the store. If you have anything other than MX style
          switches, chances are you are already aware of that and consciously made that decision. In a later article
          I'll go over all the differences between the mentioned switches and many others (including vintage switches!)
        </p>
        <h5>PCB</h5>
        <p>
          If switches are the heart of a mechanical keyboard, the PCB (printed circuit board) is the brain. The PCB will
          determine what physical layout the keyboard is capable of having as well as if the keyboard will be
          programmable or not. The PCB will also determine what kind of cable you will use to connect your keyboard to
          the computer. Additionally, features like RGB SMD lighting may also be installed, which simultaneously raises
          the cool-factor and price of the PCB.
          <br>
          Having a PCB with more options isn't always necessary though, as it isn't like you are going to rebuild it
          with different layouts over and over. If you have a very specific layout in mind that you want, just make sure
          that the PCB you want to use supports the layout!
        </p>
        <h5>Keycaps</h5>
        <p>
          Keycaps are a BIG deal for a lot of enthusiasts. Community designed keycap sets often sell 3,000 units or more
          and can cost over $200+ just for the caps alone. When looking at keycaps there are a few major aspects to look
          for:
        <ul>
          <li>Mount type - You want to make sure the keycap mount is the same as the switches you plan to use them with.
            MX
            is the most popular mount, by an overwhelming margin over anything else. Alps and Topre would be the next
            most
            popular mounts, though both would hold under 10% of the market combined.</li>
          <li>Profile - The keycap profile is how the cap physically looks and feels. There are quite a few profiles.
            Sculpted profiles, like Cherry and Alps, are different heights for each row of the keyboard. Uniform
            profiles,
            like DSA, utilize the same height for every key.</li>
          <li>Legend type is another important aspect of keycaps to pay attention to. I will go into far more detail on
            this
            is my keycap specific article. For now here is a quick summary of the different types of legends:
            Double shot keycaps are the nicest variety as they utilize a separate mold for the legend as the rest of the
            cap. This means the legend will never wear off.</li>
          <li>Dye Submilated keycaps are can be thought of as “tattoo” legends. Dye is embedded into the keycap and will
            not
            wear off due to how deep the dye is embedded in the cap.</li>
          <li>Pad Printed keycaps use two part epoxy ink. They often look like little stickers on the keycaps if you
            look
            very closely. Pad printed legends will fade and wear out quickly.</li>
          <li>Laser Etched keycaps are painted and then a laser etches the legend into the cap, removing the paint.
            These
            are the most common variety of caps you will find on keyboards where switch LED’s shine through the caps and
            illuminate the legends. Think gaming keyboards.</li>
        </ul>
        Finally, there is the actual material the keycap is made out of to take into consideration. People will often
        speak like there is a clear best material, and this is simply not the case. The most common plastics used for
        keycaps are ABS, PBT, and POM (though significantly less than the first two). ABS is very dense and commonly
        used in a lot custom sets (all Signature Plastics SA and GMK sets). Because ABS is so dense it doesn’t warp
        very easily. ABS will “shine” overtime as the oils from your skin react with it.
        <br>
        PBT is another very common material used for keycaps. It is less dense than ABS and can warp much more easily,
        but also has the benefit of being extremely resistant to shine. It also doesn’t fade in sunlight.
        The differences in these materials and how they are best utilized can be seen very easily in vintage
        keyboards.
