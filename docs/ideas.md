**Innovative Idea:** 
Our application is a website which allows for anyone interested in mechanical keyboards to join and socialize with others, learn more about mechanical keyboards, or customize their own potential custom mechanical keyboard. There are websites which provide information about keyboards or sell parts for custom mechanical keyboards but none that have both.

**Important Components:**
- Socializing page 
  - Will allow for users to share images of their own keyboard 
  - Create threads which other users can reply to 
- Information page 
  - Provide users with explainations of the different parts of a mechanical keyboard
  - Which parts they can or cannot mix and match together
- Custom designing page 
  - Will allow users to design their own custom mechanical keyboard based on their preferences 
  - Will let the user know if parts are not compatible with each other.
