| Innovative idea                                                                     | Our application is a website which allows for anyone interested in mechanical keyboards to learn more about mechanical keyboards or customize their own potential custom mechanical keyboard. The site also automatically determines compatibility between parts to allow the user to freely choose parts without having to worry about compatibility. There are websites which provide information about keyboards or sell parts for custom mechanical keyboards but none that have both.  |
| UI built using HTML and CSS                                                         | Login page, register page, info page, build page, and profile page all have their own dedicated html file. Styling is done by linking to a CSS style sheet that is universally used except for browsing page which has its own CSS file.                                                                                          |
| NodeJS backend providing data storage and processing functionality to front-end     | Server serves HTML and provides many endpoints for database management and other webpage operations such as login/logout.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Stores and retrieves data from the server                                           | All part information and user information is stored in a PostgreSQL database. User data is updated after the user completes and saves their build. This information is later retrieved on the profile page which displays the user's parts.                                                                                       |
| Supports user interactivity. Must include in-place HTML modification.               | Both building page and profile page programmatically retrieves information from the database and displays a table based on the information it retrieves.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Includes login/logout functionality. Supports user authentication and authorization | User is able to register an account on the register page then login on the login page. User can logout on any page. Build information is tied to user account.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Application deployed to Heroku                                                      | https://psi-326.herokuapp.com/                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
