# Part 0: Data Interactions

Breakdown of Work:
Andrew Leger:
    Drew all the wireframes while discussing with partners
    
    Completed the profile page.
    
    Modified the template page that Justin wrote most of, fixing bugs and rearranging some stuff. 
    Specifically: Moved body tag to end where it should be, took the center three columns out of the footer class (it shouldn't be a footer, but a row of a container), made the body tag not a container, but put a conatiner inside the body withing its own div, added a footer with bottom positioning. Added support for styles.css file, Added comments
    
    Also, I did make the styles.css page, now that I think of it.^

    Am currently writing most of this milestone1.md. Or atleast most of what's relevant to me / the framework for it.






Template For browsing page.
Note that we changed our implemenation when writing the html a little, so the sidebar on every wireframe is replaced with a top navigation bar.
